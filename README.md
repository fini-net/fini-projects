Description: _Projects and ideas for projects_

There may not need to be any code in this repo.  It is just a place for
[Issues](https://github.com/fini-net/fini-projects/issues) which should
each get **their own repo** when they are undertaken.

The motivation for this repo is so that I don't go and create all of
those empty repos just to write PRDs and repeat our delightful set
of github actions.  These are all projects that I would like to work
on and in the age of AI it seems more likely that I will work on these
with AI than that someone will come along and take an interest in tackling
them for me.  But who can predict?  Weirder things happen around me
all of the time, so it is clearly safer for me to keep my predictions
from being too definitive.
